                <p>I have lived in Austin since 1981.  I moved to the Austin area during my freshman year in high school and have lived here ever since.  I work for NXP Semiconductor as an Equipment Engineering Technician and have worked there for 31 years.  In 2001 I just south of Austin to Kyle, Texas.  I like to play golf and take my dog to the parks and nature preserves in San Marcos.
